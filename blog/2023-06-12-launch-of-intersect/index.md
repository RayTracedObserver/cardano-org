Intersect, a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem, invites the community to join and help shape Cardano's future. Founding Members can co-design Intersect and participate in governance tooling initiatives, with grants up to 1.68 million ada. Intersect, vital to the "age of Voltaire," focuses on Cardano's maintenance and development, uniting companies, developers, and individuals. Membership enables proactive involvement in Cardano's evolution, including applying for grants and participating in committees. Nigel Hemsley emphasizes Cardano's secure, transparent, and decentralized growth, supported by its large community and numerous contributors.
