The Infrastructure Survey 2024, conducted by the Cardano Foundation from April 2-8, gathered insights from 141 responses representing 239 stake pools, including four major CEXs. This survey aims to understand the needs and challenges of stake pool operators (SPOs) to enhance Cardanoâ€™s operational resilience. The findings, which account for 27% of the total active stake, highlight SPO roles in network security and resilience. The Foundation plans to conduct this survey annually to continuously improve the Cardano ecosystem.
