# Create a FAQ Section

You can use the component `<FAQSection>` to create your own FAQ sections by passing a JSON file. This example is based on the [Hello World Page](/docs/tutorial/create-a-page#add-more-components) from the previous tutorial.

## Prepare the JSON file

Create a JSON file with your questions and answers and place it in the `src/data/` directory. For this example, we'll use a pineapple on pizza FAQ:

```js title="src/data/pineappleFAQ.json"
[
  {
    "question": "Is pineapple on pizza a popular choice?",
    "answer": [
      "Pineapple on pizza, often referred to as Hawaiian pizza, has a divided fan base. Some people love the sweet and savory combination, while others are staunchly opposed to it. Despite the controversy, it remains a popular choice in many pizzerias around the world."
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "Who invented pineapple on pizza?",
    "answer": [
      "Pineapple on pizza was invented by Sam Panopoulos in 1962 in Canada. He decided to add canned pineapple to pizza as an experiment, and it surprisingly became a hit with customers."
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the arguments for and against pineapple on pizza?",
    "answer": [
      "Arguments for pineapple on pizza include:",
      "- The sweet and savory flavor combination is appealing to many.",
      "- It adds a unique taste and texture to the pizza.",
      "- Pineapple provides a refreshing contrast to the richness of the cheese and other toppings.",
      "Arguments against pineapple on pizza include:",
      "- Traditional pizza purists believe fruit does not belong on pizza.",
      "- The texture of cooked pineapple can be off-putting to some.",
      "- The flavor combination may be too unconventional for some tastes."
    ]
  }
]

```

## Add the FAQ component

Based on the Hello World example from the basic tutorial, we have imported the FAQ component here and provided the JSON file name as a parameter. Please see the highlighted changes below:

```jsx {8,43} title="src/pages/pinapple-on-pizza.js"
import Layout from "@theme/Layout";
import SiteHero from "@site/src/components/Layout/SiteHero";
import BoundaryBox from "@site/src/components/Layout/BoundaryBox";
import Divider from "@site/src/components/Layout/Divider";
import TitleWithText from "@site/src/components/Layout/TitleWithText";
import SpacerBox from "@site/src/components/Layout/SpacerBox";
import BackgroundWrapper from "@site/src/components/Layout/BackgroundWrapper";
import FAQSection from "@site/src/components/FAQSection";

function HomepageHeader() {
  const { siteTitle } = "useDocusaurusContext()";
  return (
    <SiteHero
      title="FAQ Component"
      description="This is just an example how easy it is to use components."
      bannerType="dots"
    />
  );
}

export default function Home() {

  return (
    <Layout
    title="Cardano - making the world work better for all"
    description="An open platform designed to empower billions without economic identity by offering decentralized applications for managing identity, value, and governance."
    >
      <HomepageHeader />
      <main>
        <BackgroundWrapper backgroundType="zoom">
          <BoundaryBox>
            <Divider text="Hello" />
            <TitleWithText 
              title="Hello World"
              description={[
                "some line of text",
                "Another line of text."
              ]}
              titleType="black"
              headingDot={true}
            />

          <FAQSection jsonFileName="pineappleFAQ" />
          <SpacerBox size="medium" />
          </BoundaryBox>
        </BackgroundWrapper>
      </main>
    </Layout>
  );
}

```
