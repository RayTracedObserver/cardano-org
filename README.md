# Website

Welcome to the cardano.org website. We believe that this website should be managed by a collective and not a single entity. For this to be successful, the website relies on your contributions. 

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 18.0
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.22  
On macOS you also need Xcode and Command Line Tools.

# Installation

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. This will get you up and running:

## Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-org.git
```
  
## Navigate into the folder
```
cd www-cardano-revamp
```

## Install all dependencies
```
yarn install
```

## Start local development

```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window to http://localhost:3000. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

To browse the documentation visit http://localhost:3000/docs/intro.

## Build

```
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. Always build the site once before firing a pull request as many additional checks are carried out.

## Network testing
```
yarn start --host 0.0.0.0   
```
With this command you are making it listen on all network interfaces (IP addresses) of your computer. This includes the local loopback interface (127.0.0.1 or localhost) and any other network interfaces that can connect your computer to a local network or the internet. Great for testing the site with different devices on your local network.
